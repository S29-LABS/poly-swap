  <b>Why-Venus</b> is created by muchacho, a.k.a. s29-papi. Why? Well, NFT creators should be able to enforce royalty payments, while traders can still use a familiar AMM UX. Additionally, the ease of minting new tokens and      making them available for purchase through single-sided pools should be provided to token creators.

<h1>Defination</h1>

<br/>

<p> 
  <b>Why-Venus</b> is an automated market maker (AMM) protocol that facilitates both ERC20-to-ERC20 swaps and NFT-to-ERC20 swaps (and vice versa). It leverages the use of a bonding curve, and supports ERC721 NFTs, ETH and all 
  ERC20 token types.

  While this is an entry for Encode x Aurora hackathon, why-venus is created to solve the following industry problems:  
        <br />
  <ul>
      + Royalty payments enforceable by creators. 
        <br /><br />
      + Single sided buy pools on aurora. 
        <br /><br />
      + Single sided sell pools on aurora. 
  </ul>
