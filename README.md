<p>Why-Venus is created by muchacho, a.k.a. s29-papi. Why? Well, NFT creators should be able to enforce royalty payments, while traders can still use a familiar AMM UX. Additionally, the ease of minting new tokens and making them available for purchase through single-sided pools should be provided to token creators. </p>
